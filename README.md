# mubilunity_test_mar2020

App corresponding to the Challenge requirements.

Challenge
Display scrollable list of repositories of “square” organisation in GitHub.
The app should consist of only one screen (Repositories Screen).
Each list item should have at least the name and description of the repo.
API link: https://api.github.com/orgs/square/repos
Please submit the code as a zipped project so that it can be built locally.
Hints
The challenge is deliberately left open-ended. You can do as much or as little as you see fit.
However, there are a few things that we would like to see:
● Kotlin preferred
● Testing, Unit and/or UI
● Use of dependency injection. You can use your preferred DI framework if you want
● Focus on code quality. Use your favourite architectural patterns
● You can use any libraries you want for your convenience
● A nice Material Design UI is a plus, as is handling loading/content/failure states
● You can leave notes. If you want to explain what you were thinking or trying to
achieve, document it in the code or in a README file.
